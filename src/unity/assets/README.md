# Unity Assets for Digital Twin

This directory is intended to hold 3D model assets (e.g., `.fbx`, `.obj`, `.blend`) that can be imported into Unity for building the digital twin.

## How to use:

1.  Place your robot model files (e.g., `simple_robot.fbx`) directly into this directory.
2.  Follow the instructions in `docs/module-2/chapter-2-unity-digital-twin.md` for importing the model into your Unity project.
